## Description

**cogenv/object** is a plugin for `@cogenv/core` to manage objects within environment variables, it was created with the intention of adding more cool functions to manage environment variables, but if you want something more complete, I recommend you to use the `cogenv` package that brings everything complete and robust for example: data type management, object manager, and much more ! And of course this package will be included in `cogenv` so you will have all the functions of it included inside the `cogenv` package.

In order to read the environment variables with `@cogenv/core` it is through a global variable called `cog` that basically contains the same as `process`, but `cog.env` obtains the environment variables generated by `@cogenv`.

## üì¶ Installation

To be able to use this plugin, first we will need to have installed `@cogenv/core` and then we will install this package (@cogenv/object) !

```bash
npm i --save @cogenv/object
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

First and obligatorily we will have to create a file with any of these following names or you could customize it through the `path` option that requires the `Config()` function of @cogenv/core; `.cogenv` or `.env` file !

The following data will be used as an example !

```bash
# Data for our example

APP->name=Application
APP->port=3000

DB->dialect=mysql
DB->localhost=localhost
DB->user=root
DB->password=

# Let's try something more complicated

AUTHOR->name->first = Yoni
AUTHOR->name->last = Calsin
AUTHOR->country->name = Peru
AUTHOR->country->code = PE
AUTHOR->socials->github->username = @yoicalsin
AUTHOR->socials->github->link = https://github.com/yoicalsin
AUTHOR->socials->twitter->username = @yoicalsin
AUTHOR->socials->twitter->link = https://github.com/yoicalsin
AUTHOR->socials->instagram->username = @yoicalsin
AUTHOR->socials->instagram->link = https://github.com/yoicalsin

```

It will come back like this!

```json
{
   "APP": { "name": "Application", "port": "3000" },
   "DB": {
      "dialect": "mysql",
      "localhost": "localhost",
      "user": "root",
      "password": ""
   },
   "AUTHOR": {
      "name": { "first": "Yoni", "last": "Calsin" },
      "country": { "name": "Peru", "code": "PE" },
      "socials": {
         "github": {
            "username": "@yoicalsin",
            "link": "https://github.com/yoicalsin"
         },
         "twitter": {
            "username": "@yoicalsin",
            "link": "https://github.com/yoicalsin"
         },
         "instagram": {
            "username": "@yoicalsin",
            "link": "https://github.com/yoicalsin"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Example

Wooow, this is great, isn't it, well now I'll show you how to configure it so it turns out so great that we had previously!

```js
const Cogenv = require('@cogenv/core');
const CogenvObject = require('@cogenv/object').CogenvObject;

// First we will instantiate the Config() function to obtain the environment variables
Cogenv.Config({
   // To get the types of objects in a param _objects
   objects: true, // Default: false
});

// Now we will only pass CogenvObject as a plugin !
Cogenv.Use(CogenvObject);
```

## Typescript

Hummm if you are wondering how to integrate with typescript, we have a solution for you !

```ts
// For typescript and ES7+
import { Config, Use } from '@cogenv/core';
import { CogenvObject } from '@cogenv/object';

Config({
   objects: true,
});

Use(CogenvObject);
```

And now you can use by means of the variable `cog` as follows !

```ts
const github = cog.env.AUTHOR;

console.log(github);
// It will return
/*
{
   "name": { "first": "Yoni", "last": "Calsin" },
   "country": { "name": "Peru", "code": "PE" },
   "socials": {
      "github": {
         "username": "@yoicalsin",
         "link": "https://github.com/yoicalsin"
      },
      "twitter": {
         "username": "@yoicalsin",
         "link": "https://github.com/yoicalsin"
      },
      "instagram": {
         "username": "@yoicalsin",
         "link": "https://github.com/yoicalsin"
      }
   }
}
*/
```
